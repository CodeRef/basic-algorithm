The Fibonacci Numbers is a sequence of numbers in the following order: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34... 
The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The formula for calculating these numbers is:

  F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

where:

  F(n) is the term number.
  F(n-1) is the previous term (n-1).
  F(n-2) is the term before that (n-2). 

By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence are either 0 and 1, or 1 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of 
the sequence and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
